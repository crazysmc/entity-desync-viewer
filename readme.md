# Entity Desync Viewer

This Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21 enables the debug feature 
`renderServerSideHitbox` which is present as an unused function in the 
game's code.
Enable hitboxes with F3+B and this mod will show the server-side hitboxes 
in green in addition to the normal client-side ones in white.

This only works for the _integrated server_ in singleplayer mode.

Usage examples include observing desync after sprint-punching entities or 
standing on a client-side piston head.
